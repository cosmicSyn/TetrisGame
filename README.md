# The OG Tetris 

Developed as part of a personal project, the Tetris game implemented in Python provides a classic gaming experience. This project was initiated during Summer of 2023.

## Rules

The rules for the Tetris game are straightforward:

1. Tetriminos (geometric shapes composed of four squares) fall from the top of the screen.
2. Use arrow keys to move and rotate the falling tetriminos.
3. The goal is to complete horizontal lines by arranging tetriminos to fill an entire row.
4. Completed lines are cleared, and the player scores points.
5. The game ends when the tetriminos stack up to the top of the screen.

## Features

- **User Controls:**
  - Use the arrow keys for left, right, and down movements.
  - Press the spacebar to instantly drop the tetrimino to the bottom.
  - Rotate tetriminos using the designated key.

- **Scoring:**
  - Earn points for each cleared line.
  - Score multipliers for clearing multiple lines simultaneously.

- **Game Over:**
  - The game ends when the stacked tetriminos reach the top.
  - View your final score and performance.
